# 5th Day of  SQL Challenge – Student Enrollment System

Welcome to my *5th Day SQL Challenge** 💻  

This challenges demonstrates core SQL concepts by building and querying a relational **Student Enrollment Database System**.

---

## Day-5 challenges Overview

In this challenge, I created a database named **StudentsDB** with three related tables:

- Students  
- Courses  
- Enrollments  

The project covers:

- Database creation  
- Table relationships (Primary & Foreign Keys)  
- Data insertion  
- JOIN operations  
- Numeric functions  
- String functions  
- Date functions  
- Reporting queries

## 🗂 Database Schema

### 1️⃣ Students
- StudentID (Primary Key)  
- StudentName  
- Age  
- City  

### 2️⃣ Courses
- CourseID (Primary Key)  
- CourseName  
- Duration  

### 3️⃣ Enrollments
- EnrollmentID (Primary Key)  
- StudentID (Foreign Key)  
- CourseID (Foreign Key)  
- EnrollmentDate  

---
## Database & Table Creation
- Created database `StudentsDB`
- Designed relational tables
- Defined primary and foreign keys

##Insert Sample Data
Inserted sample records into:
- Students
- Courses
- Enrollments

## INNER JOIN
Fetched students along with their enrolled courses.

## LEFT JOIN & RIGHT JOIN
- LEFT JOIN → Show all students (including those without enrollments)
- RIGHT JOIN → Show all courses (including those without enrollments)

## Numeric Functions
Used:
- ROUND()
- ABS()
- MOD()

## String Functions (Part 1)
Used:
- CONCAT()
- LENGTH()

##String Functions (Part 2)
Used:
- REPLACE()
- SUBSTRING()

## Case Conversion
Used:
- UPPER()
- LOWER()

##Date Functions
Used:
- NOW()
- DATEDIFF()
- DATE_ADD()

## Combined Enrollment Report
Built a report displaying:
- Student ID
- Enrollment ID
- Current Date & Time
- Days Difference
- Follow-up Date
